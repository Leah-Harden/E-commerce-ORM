# E-commerce Back End ORM

## Description

With my program, you can keep your products in order and easily track them. The program automatically assigns tags to each product, and you can categorize them however you prefer. If you need to make any adjustments, it's simple to modify or create new products, tags, or categories. The program was developed using Express, MySQL, and Sequelize.
